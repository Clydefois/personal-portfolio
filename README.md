# Personal portfolio

React and Vite portfolio with Personal and Professional views.

## Automated activity

GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/daily-activity.yml` daily at 15:39
Asia/Manila, with a manual run option. Each daily batch creates 10–15 explicitly
labeled automated empty commits. These represent scheduled automation, not
manual development, and do not change any portfolio files. The count varies;
the schedule is fixed and GitHub may delay or miss a run.

The workflow uses the repository's built-in token, needs no AI API key, and
works while the owner's computer is off. A date marker prevents duplicate
batches on retries. Normal push rules apply; it never force-pushes or backdates.
GitHub profile contribution visibility must be checked separately. Disable the
workflow in Actions to stop it. The previous local maintenance schedule is
superseded by this workflow.

## Local setup

Use Node.js 22.23.1 (a supported version for the package's `>=22.22.2`
requirement) and its bundled npm. Check `node --version` and `npm --version`
in the project directory before installing.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. No GitHub login is needed to view the
committed activity snapshot or run the site locally.

## Verification

Run these commands in order. The tests inspect generated build output, so a
fresh checkout needs a successful build first.

```sh
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run audit:build
git diff --check
```

Use `npm run preview` to inspect the production build locally. For interface
changes, check the affected pages in both views at desktop and mobile widths.
The existing lazy Three.js chunk can produce a build-size warning.

## Content and activity

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [VOICE.md](VOICE.md) before editing. Preserve
verified career facts, team attribution, and the shared first-person voice.

The GitHub calendar is a committed snapshot, not a live browser request.
`npm run sync:github-activity` explicitly refreshes it using authenticated
GitHub CLI access and writes `src/data/githubActivity.js`. Review the generated
diff before committing. Keep credentials out of source files.

## Publishing

Complete verification before publishing through the existing Git deployment
integration. After a push, confirm the remote commit, provider deployment
status, and live assets. A successful local build or Git push alone does not
prove the production site was updated.
